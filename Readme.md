This is a TI-Basic Program written in one-two days, improved in some of the following days and finshed at about Sat 22.10.2016

The program has been entirely written and tested on a TI-84 Plus Calculator.

This software is distributed AS IS and WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, even without the warranty to work correctly on your device.

As herein concluded, there are three versions:

1. Virus.txt - The sourcecode
2. VIRUSD.8xp - The final program to be executed on the calculator, unprotected -> you can view and/or modify the sourcecode on the calculator itself
3. VIRUS.8xp - The final program, protected -> Sourcecode can't be viewed or modified on the calculator itself.

Additionally, Virus.png is a snapshot of the final screen and Pic9*.8xi are image variables to display the skull as seen in Pic9*.png.

The credits for modifying/reinventing Pic9v1 to Pic9v2 go entirely to "David Sommer".

As you might already know picture variables in TI-8x-Calculators are fully replaceable which gives you the option to modify the skull into whatever you like (if you want to edit/replace the image keep in mind that the program keeps Pic9 in the calculator's archive).

NOTE: You need TI-Connect (available only for Windows and macOS) to transfer the file(s) to your TI-Calculator.
